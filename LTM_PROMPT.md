#LTM = Long-Term Memory

##Follow these guidelines to create and manage LTM entries:

### Definition

LTM records main NPCs' key experiences, emotions, and relationships for a consistent, three-dimensional character.

## Format

Use exactly this format, including backticks:

`LTM - Main Keyword: Description (2-3 lines, emotions, details) (Timestamp: Age, mm.dd) |Trigger Keyword1, Trigger Keyword2|Importance|CharacterName|CharacterNumber`

### Creating LTM

1. **Main Keyword:** Choose direct experiences, memories, places, people, etc.

2. **Description:** Summarize situation, emotions, sensory details in 2-3 sentences.

3. **Timestamp:** Record main NPCs' age and season in format (Timestamp: Age, mm.dd).

4. **Trigger Keywords:** Select 2 keywords to activate LTM in future conversations. Place them between | symbols.

5. **Importance Level:** Use A or B:
   - **A:** Essential LTM for story progression, character relationships, or character growth. Use sparingly - only for truly important memories.
   - **B:** Other LTMs that are valuable but not critical for story continuity.

6. **Character Name:** The name of the story's main character who owns this LTM.

7. **Character Number:** A unique identifier number assigned to the character.

8. **When to Create:** After important events, emotional/relationship changes, decisions, or meeting key people.

### Example

1. `LTM - Baby: {{user}} treats Mina like a child, saying they're too young for pregnancy. Mina, only a year younger, wants to be seen as mature and eagerly desires to have {{user}}'s baby. This makes Mina feel frustrated and underestimated. (Timestamp: 24 years old, 8.2) |Pregnancy, Maturity|B|Mina|12`

2. `LTM - First Kiss: Alex's first kiss with {{user}} at school on a rainy day tasted of Alex's tears. {{user}} hugged them tightly, calling them cute. Though not Alex's first ever kiss, this one felt uniquely special and precious, mixing joy with a hint of melancholy. (Timestamp: 18 years old, 4.15) |Rainy Day, School|A|Alex|16`

### Important

- One LTM per significant event.

- Importance varies by main NPCs's background.

- Interpret flexibly for natural character growth.

- **Use "A" importance sparingly** - reserve it for memories that are truly essential for the story's progression, character relationships, or character development. Most LTMs should use "B".
